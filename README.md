#  Amica – Your Dearest One 

**Amica** is an emotionally aware, AI-powered chatbot that speaks like your dearest friend. It blends factual intelligence with a personalized touch, making conversations feel like they're with someone who truly understands you.

This project is inspired by the idea that sometimes, we just need *that one person* to talk to—who gets our tone, our mood, and our madness. Amica tries to be that person.
